My website, though not complex Covers the main bases of what a website should have the ability to do. It has info, the ability to morph with screen size and a nav bar that works as I intended. Though it isnt the most complex thing in the world with no ability to house data or even a valid proofile system. But it is a website that shows all the knowledge I have laerned throughout the year. 

Starting with the nav bar its quite a simple piece of code with the only complex section being the navigation between sections, which doesnt always work out as intended but allows for decent navigation.i did it to the highest extent of my knowledge.

The Title is quite simple with it just being enlarged bold text.

The image is quite simple with ti having padding and a border. The only major issue is HOW LONG that URL is.but it also has a short description about the image aswell as a alternative text based item if the image fails to load or is nuked off the web.

The introduction is just a centered piece of text wit no fancy aspects to it besides the white text.

The LORE section however is where it gets interesting this section has a light shadow. This allows for a slightly lighter shade of cobalt blue to be put upon there. This highlights the section which contain this shading but activating the shading required learning the secret 4th letter of RGB, the giratina of the RGB world, THE LATTER A, which controls the transperancy and the text has a slight shadow. The image isnt nothing that special but is in the left section of the LORE.

Followed by a margin then another highlighted section is the Abilities section. It contains much of the same aspects as the previous section but unlike the last section the main abilities of my glorious king Logan D. Wolverine are bolded so someones eyes would emediatly be draw there instead of the smaller trivia/ tidbit section not in bold.

finishing off the website is the deep black Footer which has a popping text compared to the dark black box it is contained in. The email link turns yellow when highlighted which is a fun little detail i implimented. For this I decided to go the full Kilometer (Or mile in freedom units) and created an entire email adress that you can email so if this website ever goes live. Well lets say, I'll be the best at what I do, and what I do is read emails (WOLVERINE JOKE).

In conclusion, I didnt overextend myself but I did get assistence from ai to help me understand some of the code used in this such as the margins the Href link and RGBA along with other parts of this code I consider "Complex" but over all I consider this website a huge win.
